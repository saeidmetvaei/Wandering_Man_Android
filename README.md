# Wandering_Man_Android

Here is a simple android game developed in Unity 3D 2018.2. In this game a first person character is designed to walk around and explore the environment. When the character collides with an object in the scene, the game not only displays the total number of collisions that have occurred so far, but it also detects and announces the type of object with which the character has collided. The game includes two different scenes in which user is able to switch to another one by voice command of "change".

The key features of the project is listed bellow. <br />
1- The unity's Occollusion Culling system has been employed to optimize the runtime rendering process. <br />
2- The unity speach recognizer plugin (link) is utilizd to detect the voice command. <br />
3- OnTriggerEnter() function is used to be in charge of detecting collisions. <br />
4- For creating the first person character, mobile first person controller script explained here is employed. <br />
5- To navigate in the environment, use left thumb to walk and right one to manage the view and direction. <br />
6- The above-metioned script is modifed to add runing feature (by dragging the left thumb slightly more than usual), and jumping feature (by double click on screen). <br />
7- Sounds effects are added to the scenes in order to make them more realistic. <br />
